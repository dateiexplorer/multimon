# This is a config file for multimon.
# Square brackets ('[' and ']') defines a monitor output.
# To configure a setup, that can be automatically detected, you'll need to
# define a device for each output.
# 
# Each output has some attributes.
# Some of them are required (marked with a leading *), some of them are optional
#
# device    - Defines the device, which is connected to this output.
#             Run the ~/.config/multimon/tools/multimon_edid.sh file to detect,
#             which devices connected currently with which output.
#         
# *desktops - The names of the desktop, defined by bspc, separated by a comma.
#             To get all available desktops, run 'bspc query -D --names'.
#             Make sure, your setup configuration files uses all available
#             desktops to avoid data loss.
#
# *geometry - The geometry of the connected monitor in the format
#             widthxheight+x_offset+y_offset
#             e.g. (i) 1920x1080+0+0 and (ii) 1920x1080+1920+0
#             In this example output (ii) is placed left to the output (i).
